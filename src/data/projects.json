    "description": "The CS Bridge Classic program offers intensive two-week in-person courses for high school students at different universities around the world. Each course is hosted by a well-known university in the host country. 100-200 high school students live on campus for two weeks and attend classes every day. The curriculum is based on the same course Stanford University teaches our Freshmen, CS106A. Our goal is to teach the same material to high school students worldwide, in-person, in small group settings. "
